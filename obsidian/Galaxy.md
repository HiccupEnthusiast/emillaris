The galaxy is one of the principal screens the player will play in. It shows the [[#Hyperlane network]] and different [[System#System features|system features]] that span multiple systems.

# Hyperlane network

The galaxy contains different [[System|systems]] connected with each other by hyperlanes. In order for a ship to move from system to system it needs to have a hyperlane connection. The ship will need to charge its [[hyperlane component]] to enter the hyperspace and rapidly move between systems. The amount of systems a ship can traverse while being on hyperspace before having to enter it again can be incremented from several sources, mainly the hyperlane component.

Different [[starbase]] improvements can interact with the hyperlane, mainly [[relays]], [[hyperspace wells]] and [[disruptors]]. The owner of the dominant starbase is the owner of the hyperlane node. Starbases, specially with colonized planets are the main emitter of culture. Starbases are the backbone of the resource network of the different empires.

# Resource network

Under normal circumstances, planets deficits and surplus get are shared all across the empire. However, there are [[Planet#Occupation|circumstances where a planet is disconnected from the network]]. In these cases the planet will sustain itself purely from its local produce. Planets should have a local stockpile that serves as a buffer for:
- Store essential resources so the planet general population doesn't get affected negatively (for example a lack of [[sustenance resource]]).
- Store the production of the planet while it is cut-off, if the original owner recaptures the city it should recover at least some of the produce it would have gained otherwise. Conversely if the attacking player can capture the planet it should be able to obtain some of those resources as well. 
# Supply lines

Similar to the resource network. Ships must have access to supplies such as ammo. In warfare a part of a ships ammo might come from scavenging enemy ships, stealing production from an occupied planet or from supply lines.
