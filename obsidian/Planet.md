Planets are the main [[common resource]] and secondary [[special resource]] sources. More specifically, [[#population]] working in [[#districts]] or [[#buildings]] are the ones that generate said resources. 

Planets have three main characteristics, [[#kind]] which determines the habitability and maybe possible special [[#features]], the latter being another characteristic of the planet giving bonuses, maybe even requirements to districts and buildings. The last characteristic is size, which *could* determine the maximum ideal population of a planet, how defensible it is, a direct cap to the total amount of districts, the maintenance, among other things, the size of the planet *may* not even be a feature of the game at all. 

The planet view should show a grid where districts can be built. This system takes inspiration from the system with the same name present in Civilization VI. At the very least districts should have continuity bonuses, for example, "industrial" districts should connect all to each other amplifying their effects.

Additionally it should show the possible buildings that can be built inside each district. Plus a way to manage the population. 

It should also provide an overview of local production and deficit.

# Kind

Even if "planet size" doesn't make it into a full fledged feature, the kind of a planet is determined by a matrix of characteristics, one of which is the size of the planet. This is so things like small gaseous planets are either impossible or extremely rare. 

Two of the biggest categorizations should be determined by the temperature and atmosphere of the planet. Some planets being too inhospitable for any kind of life, while others even if hostile could sustain some kinds of lifeforms and finally the inhabitable planets. These characteristics should also give weights to certain kinds of [[#Features| planet features]] for planets that are inhabitable to some degree and [[System#Resource bodies| resources]] for those that are completely inhospitable. 

More characteristics could be added depending on the need of variety.
#  Features 

Features are things that sometimes are present in planets. Most features should provide simple easy to effects that are clearly good or clearly bad. They should mainly affect the resource production, incentivizing the specialization of a planet. Some features should provide a cost benefit decision. Giving good and bad effects at the same time. Features should be significant enough to make other empires prioritize them over anything else.

# Districts

Districts are the things that are built on top of tiles. Some districts should have hard caps on how many can be built (like the district to represent the central administration of the planet). While others would be soft capped by the tiles themselves (like resource districts not having resource tiles to be built on) and others should be completely uncapped, possibly giving some sort of negative.

Inside districts buildings are built. These buildings *may* be capped by district/planet as well. 
# Buildings

Buildings are the main source of jobs for the population. Buildings should always have some sort of maintenance cost. What kind of resource and the amount it costs should depend on the strategic value it provides.

# Population 

Population is the main source of jobs and as such is the main source of most resources. Each citizen requires a [[sustenance resource]], [[satisfaction resource]] and has a general [[happiness statistic]] and a [[specie]]. Low sustenance slowly makes the population less productive and may even kill them. Low satisfaction lowers productivity and affects happiness. Low happiness produces local and global (if it exists) unrest. High unrest lowers the productivity of the whole planet and may even lead to certain events depending on the source and severity of the unrest. 
# Ownership 

The owner of a planet is the one who will receive the planet's production and will have to pay for the planet's deficit. At first the owner is the first empire that colonizes the planet. Ownership of the system can be changed either by a [[coup]] or by giving it away in a peace treaty. While in war, when a player defeats the defensive army of a planet this falls under occupation until a peace treaty is signed. This isn't the case for a [[total war]], in which case the planet skips the ownership phase and the owner changes immediately. 

# Occupation

When a planet is under occupation, it could be disconnected from the original's owner [[./Galaxy#Resource network| resource network]] (depends on the [[kind of war]]). While occupied special events might happen that could help or damage the occupier. The occupier can't change a lot about the planet directly, special decisions may unlock to help the integration for the planet or to damage the planet once occupation ends.
