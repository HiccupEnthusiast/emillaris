The system screen presents all the [[ships]] and [[planets]] inside the system. The main features of the system view is to manage the colonized planets and exploit the different possible [[resource bodies]]. 

# System features

A system may have different features, these can have a large array of effects. From making energy based combat technologies like [[shields]] or [[energy weapons]] less effective to providing some kind of events to nearby planets more often.  
# Planet

Planets are the main way that the player will interact with its economy. Like systems, planets will have [[features]] that give them tiles in which different [[buildings]] can be built. Most features should be simple, either good or bad, some of the bad ones should be removable. Some features should present cost benefit opportunities. Some building should interact with close tiles as well (for example an [[industrial complex]] should make nearby [[farmlands]] should make the farmlands less productive/trigger events). 
# Resource bodies
A resource body can't be normally colonized. These are usually inhabitable bodies that could be exploited for resources like asteroid belts or some gas giants. In order to exploit them and a [[building ship]] must be used, some may need specific technologies to unlock the option to build on them.
