The system screen presents all the [[ships]] and [[#planets]] inside the system. The main features of the system view is to manage the colonized planets and exploit the different possible [[#resource bodies]]. 

# System features

A system may have different features, these can have a large array of effects. From making energy based combat technologies like [[shields]] or [[energy weapons]] less effective to providing some kind of events to nearby planets more often. Clicking on a planet will open the [[Planet|planet view]].
# Planet

Planets are the main way that the player will interact with its economy. Like systems, planets could have [[Planet#Features|planet features]] that give them special tiles in which different [[Planet#Buildings|buildings]] can be built. Most features should be simple, either good or bad, some of the bad ones should be removable. Some features should present cost benefit opportunities. 
# Resource bodies

A resource body can't be normally colonized. These are usually uninhabitable bodies that could be exploited for resources, inside this category things like asteroid belts or gas giants exists. 
In order to exploit them an [[building ship]] must be used, some may need specific technologies to unlock the option to build on them (maybe). 
They *may* be the main source of [[special resources]].

# Ownership

The ownership of a system is given by who controls the [[main starbase]] inside the system. The main ways to obtain one would be:
- If no starbase is present, the first empire to build one will take ownership of the system
- If a [[fleet]] can defeat the starbase defenses the system will change ownership 
- If a starbase is destroyed, the owner of the starbase with the biggest "presence (military/cultural?)" will take ownership, first allies, then close empires, then random.

Ownership of a system determines the galaxy wide borders. Additionally if there were to be empire wide effects inside the system, the owner would take the full or most of the effect.
