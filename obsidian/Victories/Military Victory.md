There are two ways to achieve a military victory. Domination and extermination.
# Extermination

This involves [[directly controlling]] a large portion of the galaxy in addition to rendering all other players irrelevant. The exact conditions of what would make a player irrelevant are up on the air, but on one end it would be not controlling a single [[planet]] and not having [[any way to recover one]]. 

# Domination

This involves [[directly controlling]] a big portion of the galaxy, very possibly less than the one required by [[#Extermination]] in addition to having a great amount of forceful control over every other player. As of right now the only way to achieve this would be via the [[subjects]] system.
