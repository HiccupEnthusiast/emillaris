There are two ways to win via technology. Supremacy and willing submission. 

# Supremacy 

Supremacy involves researching and building an ultimate weapon. It should be multi stepped and show warnings to every player, giving the option to neutralize the threat. 

# Willing submission 

This victory works along side the [[Senate]]. It needs the majority of the relevant players to be inside it. It involves a series of research fairs that would give different breakthroughs. In order to win the player must proclaim its desire contributing a large portion of work to a certain number of fairs. Any player may refuse to concede the victory even after someone else proclaimed victory. If they do it they will suffer several maluses and sanctions from the Senate, ultimately leading to allowing the proclaiming player to use the products of the fair to forcefully assimilate dissident parties.
