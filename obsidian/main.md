The game will mainly contain two screens with various overlays. The [[galaxy]] and the [[system]] screens. The main vectors which the player interacts with are [[systems and their hyperlanes]] and [[planets inside systems]].

The game will focus on the [[warfare]] aspect. Everything the player does should help directly or indirectly to this goal. There are two main ways to engage in combat, [[Space Combat]] and [[ground combat]]. War should be a long term effort for the majority of the game, a mechanic that exemplifies this the [[capturing and integrating]] of enemy planets. As the game progresses options to make warfare faster are unlocked.

In order to maintain a competent army the empire will need a stable [[economy]]. The main system to interact with this economy is the [[population of planets]]. The economy systems should directly influence the capacity to build and maintain a [[navy]] and [[army]], on top of indirectly affecting them, (like a resource that affects the output of all other resources including one(s) required by the army/navy).

Additionally the [[government]] can help to shape the size and utility of the army and navy, as well as the production of different resources. 

[[Technology]] is the main system on which the player can improve their warfare capacities. Mainly for new kinds of [[ships]] and [[weapons]] but also for various bonuses.

[[Culture]] has a broader impact on warfare, either by directly unlocking new things or by the lack of said unlocks or bonuses when fighting an empire with them. This plays a huge factor when integrating new planets to the empire.

Some [[societal pillars]] can also help with warfare greatly, specially with bonuses, helped further down by [[foundation of power]]. 

[[Diplomacy]] can take a big part of warfare, especially mid to late game where the player has met many players. It also allows for a "[[softer way of warfare]]".
